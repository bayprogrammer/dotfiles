  Time is finite, but potential
  distractions are endless. To do
  anything useful, we must say no to
  most things of potential interest.

  Prioritization is a necessity to be
  effective: procrastination is required
  to become an expert in just a couple
  high-value things. If you don't set
  priorities for yourself, someone else
  will set them for you.
